List a ::= Null | List a (List a)

List is now a module, which exports to the current context the type List and the constructor List.
Null is not exported; it must be referred to as List.Null. This helps to prevent namespace polution.

	name :string 
	gender :Gender

defines: Person (type), Person (constructor), Person.name, Person.gender (the latter two are fields/functions)
